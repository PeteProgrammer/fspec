FSpec
=====

_RSpec inspired test framework for F#_

The aim of this project is to provide a test framework to the .NET platform
having the same elegance as the RSpec framework has on Ruby.

The code is still in a very exploratory state, so the actual syntax for writing
tests may change. 

The framework is currently self testing, i.e. the framework is used to test
itself.
